# ✈️ Flight Operations Data Pipeline

### 🏅 Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end data pipeline** using **Apache Airflow** and **Snowflake**, designed according to the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers).

The pipeline ingests raw flight operations data, processes it through multiple transformation stages, and loads aggregated **business KPIs** into a cloud data warehouse for analytics and reporting.

Developed as a **Data Engineering portfolio project**, this repository focuses not only on final outputs, but also on **real-world challenges**, **debugging scenarios**, and **technical decision-making** commonly encountered in production-grade data pipelines.

### 🔄 Data Flow

#### 🥉 Bronze Layer

- Ingests raw flight data in JSON format
- Stores data in its original form to ensure traceability and enable reprocessing

#### 🥈 Silver Layer

- Performs data cleansing and normalization
- Applies schema standardization and data quality validation

#### 🥇 Gold Layer

- Aggregates curated data into business-level KPIs
- Produces analytics-ready datasets

#### 🏢 Data Warehouse

- Loads Gold-layer data into **Snowflake**
- Uses `MERGE` (upsert) logic to ensure idempotent and reliable data loads

## 📈 Dashboard & Analytics

The final output of this pipeline feeds into a visualization layer (e.g., Streamlit, Tableau, or Snowflake Dashboards) to monitor real-time flight metrics processed by the **Gold Layer**:

### 📊 Key Metrics Monitored:

- **Global Volume:** Real-time count of active flights and aircraft on the ground.
- **Traffic by Country:** High-volume traffic analysis by origin country (e.g., US, Canada, Ireland).
- **Operational Efficiency:** Average fleet airspeed velocity trends over time.

### ⚙️ Orchestration

- **Apache Airflow**, running in a Docker-based environment, is used to orchestrate and monitor the pipeline execution.

## 🔗 DAG Design

The Airflow DAG is designed with **linear task dependencies** to maintain data integrity across pipeline stages.

- ⏱ **Schedule:** Every 30 minutes
- 🔁 **Retry Policy:** Configurable per task
- 🔄 **XCom:** Used to pass file paths between tasks

## 🧊 Snowflake Data Model

### 📊 Table: `FLIGHT_KPIS`

| Column         | Description                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| window_start   | Aggregation window timestamp     |
| origin_country | Flight origin country            |
| total_flights  | Total number of flights          |
| avg_velocity   | Average flight velocity          |
| on_ground      | Number of aircraft on the ground |
| load_time      | Data load timestamp              |

🔑 **Primary Key:** `(window_start, origin_country)`
